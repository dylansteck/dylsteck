Productivity and personal development have been topics of fascination by the most advanced technologists, yet the community of knowledge management and tools for thought enthusiasts never found a home nor a true voice until the rise of Roam. The community races to build extensions for Roam despite the lack of a public API, engages in lengthy Twitter threads with the product's founder and evangelist, Conor White-Sullivan, about the product's features, and shares organizational hacks. In the process, Conor has taught users about the efficacy of certain note-taking methods in Roam, with some yielding high output from users that need it the most(eg. those who deal with the most knowledge and have the most difficult time organizing it). As the community focuses mostly on the upkeep involved in organizing a Roam graph or a Notion page, I offer a glimpse into the future of thought work. What if we managed work activity in the same way we so finely maintain our Roam graphs?\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"For those who might not be familiar, here's how Roam works in a nutshell: Roam is a note-taking app that helps users organize and contextualize knowledge. Users create bidirectional links for each named entity(\\\"real world\\\" objects, such as places, people, ideas, or events) in their notes, so they can see every reference to a named entity, as well as the context within which it was referenced. Roam features a toolbelt of advanced commands to manipulate text the same way a statistician would master functions in Microsoft Excel. For example, a user can filter specific references to a named entity, embed code blocks and images into notes, embed references to text snippets between different notes, and even learn notes with spaced repetition.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Users who become fully invested in organizing their knowledge and spend lots of time working with loads of data tend to get the most out of Roam. In particular, the Zettlekasten note-taking method has been popularized by #roamcult, which emphasizes constant note-taking to enlarge the number of connections between concepts and help one build knowledge. This system requires a lot of hands-on work but has helped many, especially knowledge workers, organize their work. It has also emphasized writing as an important part of the creative process for any discipline, especially product design, one that is so subjective.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"While a tool for thought(namely Roam) helps produce a rich graph of contextualized notes and(if properly followed) can help users produce better ideas/learn more, notes generally aren't the only part of a user's workflow, even if the user is a knowledge worker, simply because of how many steps and applications typical workflows require. Even if a knowledge worker's only other app interaction is searching Google, a database, or a website, a knowledge worker still makes multiple decisions and inquiries that lead them to either augment the search query, read a particular website/data entry/article, or click a link. This non-linear search process called berrypicking is one that most people follow as they search the web, but is one that is highly utilized by knowledge workers, who surface multiple sources, search results, and webpages to collect the context necessary to augment the search query, find the right results, or come to certain conclusions/form certain hypotheses.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"And yes, it's important to focus on the learning process and understanding that the knowledge worker must make their interpretations of the information they are presented. However, a knowledge worker could be much more productive and make better use of contextualized information if they had a language to organize the rest of their workflow with the same degree of specificity and the same access to context as in Roam. Other professions have advanced tools that they use to do their work and track their progress(insert examples), so why can't knowledge workers?\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Here are a few examples of tools that can be crafted for creatives to help them experience the quantum leaps in their productivity, creativity, and cognition as they work, the same way Roam has for knowledge workers:\"]]],[3,\"ol\",[[[0,[],0,\"An advanced editing tool for interface and interaction designers\"]]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Other creative disciplines have advanced software they can use. Knowledge workers can use Roam, a software engineer can use an IDE, a video editor can use advanced editing software, a music producer can use a DAW, the list goes on and on. All of these tools have steep learning curves but offer rich languages for building creative material and, over time, creatives experience exponential increases in their productivity, just as one sees exponential increases in memory as they expand their Roam graph and their usage of the spaced repetition system. Interface designers, however, are stuck to vector-based software programs, such as Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop/XD. While these programs are easy to use and allow designers to streamline certain parts of their workflow, motion design features are limited, as are design system features, which seem too primitive and assume that a feature has to be implemented a certain way regardless of the context, which doesn't offer much room for exploration. Some tools, such as Framer and Facebook Origami, attempt to create languages to prototype interactions or further customize interface designs, but overall, designers are stuck using primitive vector-based systems that enforce a very \\\"static\\\" style of design and make it harder to use design software as a legitimate tool in a project or its tech stack, or just help the designer best express themself.\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"2. Online databases and berrypicking\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A knowledge worker might spend a lot of time in Roam and Notion organizing their notes and trying to learn it, but for anyone who is working with content, or in some other way, there is other work and thinking done outside of Roam that users can't properly organize or record. Take the way people search, for example.

Productivity and personal development have been topics of fascination by the most advanced technologists, yet the community of knowledge management and tools for thought enthusiasts never found a home nor a true voice until the rise of Roam. The community races to build extensions for Roam despite the lack of a public API, engages in lengthy Twitter threads with the product's founder and evangelist, Conor White-Sullivan, about the product's features, and shares organizational hacks. In the process, Conor has taught users about the efficacy of certain note-taking methods in Roam, with some yielding high output from users that need it the most(eg. those who deal with the most knowledge and have the most difficult time organizing it). As the community focuses mostly on the upkeep involved in organizing a Roam graph or a Notion page, I offer a glimpse into the future of thought work. What if we managed work activity in the same way we so finely maintain our Roam graphs?</p><p>For those who might not be familiar, here's how Roam works in a nutshell: Roam is a note-taking app that helps users organize and contextualize knowledge. Users create bidirectional links for each named entity(\"real world\" objects, such as places, people, ideas, or events) in their notes, so they can see every reference to a named entity, as well as the context within which it was referenced. Roam features a toolbelt of advanced commands to manipulate text the same way a statistician would master functions in Microsoft Excel. For example, a user can filter specific references to a named entity, embed code blocks and images into notes, embed references to text snippets between different notes, and even learn notes with spaced repetition.</p><p>Users who become fully invested in organizing their knowledge and spend lots of time working with loads of data tend to get the most out of Roam. In particular, the Zettlekasten note-taking method has been popularized by #roamcult, which emphasizes constant note-taking to enlarge the number of connections between concepts and help one build knowledge. This system requires a lot of hands-on work but has helped many, especially knowledge workers, organize their work. It has also emphasized writing as an important part of the creative process for any discipline, especially product design, one that is so subjective.</p><p>While a tool for thought(namely Roam) helps produce a rich graph of contextualized notes and(if properly followed) can help users produce better ideas/learn more, notes generally aren't the only part of a user's workflow, even if the user is a knowledge worker, simply because of how many steps and applications typical workflows require. Even if a knowledge worker's only other app interaction is searching Google, a database, or a website, a knowledge worker still makes multiple decisions and inquiries that lead them to either augment the search query, read a particular website/data entry/article, or click a link. This non-linear search process called berrypicking is one that most people follow as they search the web, but is one that is highly utilized by knowledge workers, who surface multiple sources, search results, and webpages to collect the context necessary to augment the search query, find the right results, or come to certain conclusions/form certain hypotheses.</p><p>And yes, it's important to focus on the learning process and understanding that the knowledge worker must make their interpretations of the information they are presented. However, a knowledge worker could be much more productive and make better use of contextualized information if they had a language to organize the rest of their workflow with the same degree of specificity and the same access to context as in Roam. Other professions have advanced tools that they use to do their work and track their progress(insert examples), so why can't knowledge workers?</p><p>Here are a few examples of tools that can be crafted for creatives to help them experience the quantum leaps in their productivity, creativity, and cognition as they work, the same way Roam has for knowledge workers:</p><ol><li>An advanced editing tool for interface and interaction designers</li></ol><p>Other creative disciplines have advanced software they can use. Knowledge workers can use Roam, a software engineer can use an IDE, a video editor can use advanced editing software, a music producer can use a DAW, the list goes on and on. All of these tools have steep learning curves but offer rich languages for building creative material and, over time, creatives experience exponential increases in their productivity, just as one sees exponential increases in memory as they expand their Roam graph and their usage of the spaced repetition system. Interface designers, however, are stuck to vector-based software programs, such as Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop/XD. While these programs are easy to use and allow designers to streamline certain parts of their workflow, motion design features are limited, as are design system features, which seem too primitive and assume that a feature has to be implemented a certain way regardless of the context, which doesn't offer much room for exploration. Some tools, such as Framer and Facebook Origami, attempt to create languages to prototype interactions or further customize interface designs, but overall, designers are stuck using primitive vector-based systems that enforce a very \"static\" style of design and make it harder to use design software as a legitimate tool in a project or its tech stack, or just help the designer best express themself.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">this is why product designers need an IDE, not a drawing tool<br><br>600+ variants?? and the mechanic for creating them is…editing each one by hand???<br><br>the sheer lack of imagination in design tooling astounds me <a href=\"https://t.co/3MdPMNxQFs\">https://t.co/3MdPMNxQFs</a></p>&mdash; devin // (@theflowingsky) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theflowingsky/status/1332020417410834433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 26, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<figcaption>A tweet capturing the essence of why product designers need an IDE</figcaption></figure><p>2.
